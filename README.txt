This is a semi-faithful Pacman clone that I made several years ago.

It is written in Processing JS. The Processing app can be downloaded here (https://processing.org/download); however, it is not necessary to be able to run the completed app (Pacman.app), which is ready to be run immediately on OS X.

To play the game, launch the app. Press SPACE to add credits,  then press ENTER to start, then use the arrow keys to control Pacman.
